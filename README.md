# Compiling from source

If you want to run the latest development/beta version of Winditor from source, follow the instructions below.

First download and install Visual Studio 2019.

Then use git to download the source code with this command:  
`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LordNed/Winditor.git`  
Downloading the source code as a zip won't work as that does not include submodules.  

Finally, open Winditor.sln in Visual Studio and build the solution.
